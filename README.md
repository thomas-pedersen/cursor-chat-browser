## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Cursor editor installation with chat history

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/thomas-pedersen/cursor-chat-browser.git
  cd cursor-chat-browser
  ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Configuration

The application automatically detects your Cursor workspace storage location based on your operating system:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage`
- WSL2: `/mnt/c/Users/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage`
- Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage`
- Linux (remote/SSH): `~/.cursor-server/data/User/workspaceStorage`

If automatic detection fails, you can manually set the path in the Configuration page (‚öôÔ∏è).

**Note:** Recent versions of Cursor have moved chat data storage from workspace-specific locations to global storage. This application now supports both storage methods to ensure compatibility with all Cursor versions.
